# Battelship
Dec/2019 - I copied Battelship game from "Head First! Programing in JavaScript" during learning process. <br>
03/04/2021 - It needs some improvements... so, lets start! :-) <br>
05/04/2021 - Final version (so far...) has been uploaded.

There are stil some features to add, like better UX, input for saving players' names and set up local storage to collect scores. So, feel free to colaborate.

Rules are simple: on the board find three hidden ships - three squares long each.

In order to play, you will have to copy:
  - index.html file,
  - css folder,
  - js folder,
  - images folder.
